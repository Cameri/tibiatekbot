= Introduction =

The Configuration Manager is a tool that allows the user to automatically use commands of the bot when a certain character logins.


= How to Use =

To open the Configuration Manager's editable text box use the command *&config edit*.
On the text box write each command on a separate line. 

After pressing *Ok* all changes will be saved under this file:
`{TTB Root}\Profiles\{Character World}\{Character Name}\config.txt`

*Note ^1^:* this file can also be edited from any other text editor.

To manually load the Configuration Manager changes use the command *&config load*.


*Example of a proper input:*
{{{
&exp on
&loot on
&attack on
}}}

*Recommended input:
{{{
&exp on
&exp creatures on
&light on
&stacker on
&loot on
&eat on
&spell 30 "exura "":3"
&uh 300
