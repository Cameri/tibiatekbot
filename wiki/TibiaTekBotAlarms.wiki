*Messager Player:* checks whether a certain player has to be informed.

*Player To Be Messaged:* sends a message informing of the activated alarm to the player whose name is written on this input.

The Alarms window is divided into four different tabs: Battlelist, Message, Status and Items. These four tabs are the different alarm types respectively. See the image below:
